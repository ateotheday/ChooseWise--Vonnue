Title: Switching Career Domains

Option Roles:
- stay (continue current role/domain)
- switch (move to a new role/domain)

Purpose:
Support structured thinking when considering changing career paths.

Common Scenarios:
- Core engineering → IT
- Non-tech → Tech
- Corporate → Government
- Job → Entrepreneurship
- Service-based role → Product-based role

Criteria Templates:
- skill transferability
- reskilling time
- financial risk
- savings buffer
- market demand
- job competition intensity
- portfolio strength
- certification requirement
- networking availability
- emotional resilience
- passion alignment
- long-term scalability

Tradeoffs:
- Career switch may reduce short-term salary.
- High-demand fields require intense learning.
- Passion-based decisions increase satisfaction but increase uncertainty.
- Staying safe may reduce regret but limit growth.

Evaluation Prompts:
- Is this dissatisfaction temporary or structural?
- Do I have a concrete transition plan?
- Can I handle months of uncertainty?
- What proof will I show employers?
- Am I comparing myself unfairly to experts?

Decision Patterns:
- Try role shift before full domain shift.
- Test interest via side projects before quitting.
- Build portfolio before resigning.
- Transition gradually if financial risk is high.

Risk Notes:
- Switching without roadmap increases failure risk.
- Emotional decisions without research lead to regret.
- Underestimating competition slows transition.
