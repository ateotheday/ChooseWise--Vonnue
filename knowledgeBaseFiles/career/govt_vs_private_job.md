Tradeoffs:
- Government jobs offer strong stability but slower financial growth.
- Private roles offer faster income growth but performance pressure.
- Government roles often provide pension security.
- Private sector exposes employees to modern tools and global practices.
- Government promotions may depend on tenure rather than performance.

Evaluation Prompts:
- Do I prefer predictability over ambition-driven growth?
- Am I comfortable with competitive performance culture?
- How important is long-term financial ceiling?
- Does pension security influence my peace of mind?

Decision Patterns:
- Risk-averse personality → government role may fit.
- High ambition + skill-growth orientation → private sector.
- Desire for structured life → government.
- Desire for innovation exposure → private.

Risk Notes:
- Long preparation cycles for government exams.
- Private sector layoffs in downturn.
- Skill stagnation risk in slow-evolving roles.
