Tradeoffs:
- Higher studies delay income but may raise earning ceiling.
- Work builds industry experience but may limit academic depth.
- Foreign degree increases exposure but increases financial burden.
- Higher studies without clarity reduces ROI.

Evaluation Prompts:
- Is the degree mandatory for my target career?
- Do I genuinely enjoy academic depth?
- Can I sustain exam preparation pressure?
- Will the degree meaningfully differentiate me?
- Is my motivation growth-driven or fear-driven?

Decision Patterns:
- Academia/research → higher studies necessary.
- Unsure specialization → work first.
- Financial pressure → job first.
- Clear niche target → higher studies aligned.

Risk Notes:
- Entering workforce late may delay financial independence.
- Degree inflation reduces value without differentiation.
- Academic burnout if motivation is unclear.
